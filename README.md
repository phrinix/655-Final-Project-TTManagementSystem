# 655-Final-Project-TTManagementSystem
Following is my college final subject's final project. I choose to create Ticketing System using ASP.NET

In this project I used bootstrap "collapse" with ASP.NET function "Repeater" to show dynamic data which was quite challange to do but in the end I successfuly completed it.

# Ticket and Task Management System
This was the Final project choosen by me and my partner for our last course. It's a Web Application using ASP.NET.
# Executive Summary
In today’s technological world, technical support has become an important aspect in any field for any kind of work. The increase in demand for better and user-friendly technology has made it very difficult especially for IT personnel to provide the best client support experience. This project is design to assist IT personnel to provide client support in an organised approach based on location and manage the issues more effectively. The product will allow clients to submit a ticket based on location and keep track on any updates whereas it will allow technicians to acknowledge and update the tickets as they are escalated or resolved. It also allows, both the clients and technician to login to the system using fingerprint authentication or password verification. In addition, this product delivers a task management system which allows technicians to assign, manage and complete task efficiently as a team. Hence, making the product a 2-in-1 ticket and task management system providing the best client support in an organised manner.  

# Introduction
Ticketing System is a very important tool used by all the customer service providers in any department. In this venture, we are concentrating on IT based Ticketing System. Motivation for creating this project was gained from our experience working with the ticketing system during our co-op work term. The problem faced during work term was that there was no location-based ticketing system which created difficulties in tracking issue history for one specific location. In addition, there was no task management system to keep management organised. As a result, this idea came into to place to develop a location-based ticket and task management web application named TT Management System.

# Product Requirements
•	Oracle database is created to store information of all the clients, technicians and tickets
•	Fingerprint Scanner helps user to login to the ticket management system by authenticating information from Oracle database
•	Client-side GUI allows user to create ticket and follow up on the updates
•	Technician-side GUI allows to check current tickets, and assign task to competent technician 
•	Forgot Password feature allows user to change their password by answering the security questions

# Product Specifications 
•	Fingerprint Scanner: 0.15 sec recognition speed, USB 3.0 interface
•	Oracle database (SQL scripting)
•	ASP.NET Framework

# Operating Instructions
This web application will be used by 2 type of users: Clients and Technicians. Both users can be authenticated with a fingerprint or given credentials. When issue occurs, client can address the issue to IT by creating a ticket based on the location or room number. Once the ticket is created it gets added to the current issue list which can be acknowledged by the technicians for further investigation. The users can keep track of their created tickets listed on the web page based on location under their profile. In addition, the web application contains a task management system which allows the technicians to assign task to other technicians as required and resolve the issue in an organise manner as a team. This makes the task completion faster and easy to track to provide better client support. Moreover, both the users have the privilege to change their password by answering the security questions. The system has an admin user who has all the administrator rights. For example, admin user can change the password and update fingerprints for any user account. 

# Conclusion and Further Developments
In conclusion, the system delivers a scalable and cost-effective tool for IT to provide a satisfactory client support experience. The system allows the user to increase or decrease storage as required and uses a universal .Net Framework making it desirable for companies. The system uses oracle database which provides cloud-based pay as you go service which makes the system scalable. The front-end languages used to create this tool are C#, HTML and CSS which are very basic and known to almost all developers which does not often require companies to outsource maintenance or upgradation if necessary. Moreover, the main aim of the system is to deliver one stop for managing task and tickets by the technicians which provides them with a flexible and comfortable platform for supplying customer support.
In future, with more advancement in technological world, we can add the enhanced collaboration element in which multiple technicians can collaborate on the same issue simultaneously using powerful feature like Ticket Chat, and as a result it will be more quicker to resolve the issues of clients. Secondly, we can add the ticket automation feature which can perform many tasks, from assigning the ticket to specific technician and sending email notification for any changes to the ticket to the clients and it is useful to complete the tasks on-time.
